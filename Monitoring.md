
### System Monitoring Objectives :

- Ensure System Availability
- Improve System Reliability
- Enhance System Security




 ### the main areas of concern when monitoring a system:

    1. CPU Load.
    2. Memory Usage.
    3. Disk Usage.
    4. Network Traffic
    5. Running Processes and Services
    6. User Activity and Login Sessions
    7. Security Events and Vulnerabilities


### How can you check what are the most memory intensive running processes ?

The "RES" column represents the resident set size, which is the amount of physical memory (RAM) that a process is currently using. Processes with higher values in the "RES" column are consuming more memory.

**System Uptime**: the server has been up for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
**Users**: There are currently 3 users logged in.
**Load Average**: The load average for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes is 0.07, 0.02, and 0.00 respectively. This indicates that the server is lightly loaded.
**Tasks**: There are a total of 84 tasks, with 1 running, 83 sleeping, and none stopped or zombie.

-**CPU and Memory Usage**:
-**CPU Usage**: The CPU usage is negligible, with 100.0% idle time.
**Memory Usage**:
- Total memory: 1977.0 MiB
- Free memory: 1521.7 MiB
- Used memory: 263.9 MiB
- Buffers/cache: 341.3 MiB



### What are log files? Where can you fin them on a typical Linux system ?
- log files are files that contain records of events, actions, and system messages generated by operating systems, applications, and services running on a computer system.
- On a typical Linux system, log files are usually stored in the /var/log directory.
